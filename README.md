simple-bypass
=============

Bypass firewalls for named hosts and specific ports easily.

This utility works by creating SSH-tunnels and host-name overrides.

For this utility to work, you need access to a SSH-server on a unfiltered network. The SSH-server itself has to be reachable on the network where other bypasses are wanted.

TODO: implement.
